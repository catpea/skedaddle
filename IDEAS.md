## Future Ideas

### Animated Backgrounds

1. **Midjourney** generates pixel art background
2. **Multiple layers** scroll at different speeds (parallax)
3. **Character walk cycle** overlaid
4. **Morse kitty** in the corner
5. **Scooby Doo technique** with modern tools

Imagine:
- Cyberpunk city scrolling background
- 8-bit cat walking animation
- Corner morse kitty sending messages
- All at 60fps smooth parallax
- Pure **After Dark screensaver** energy

This is **absolutely** the next project.

### Interactive Version

- User types message
- Real-time preview of morse animation
- Adjustable speed slider
- Download button
- Share to social media

Web app version would be **incredible**.

### Multi-Cat Messages

- Different cats for different letters
- Tabby cat = letters A-M
- Siamese = letters N-Z
- Black cat = numbers
- Full cast of morse operatives

### Steganography Mode

Hide morse in apparently normal video:
- Cat walks across screen
- Each step is morse timing
- Looks like random cat behavior
- Actually encoding message
